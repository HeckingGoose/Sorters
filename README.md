# Sorters - A Python module that contains various sorting algorithms.
**Built for Python 3.10+**

I have decided that I am now sick of having to write sorting algorithms every time I need to sort data and so have decided to make my own module that simply contains various sorting algorithms that can be called from another script.

### To do (Sorting algorithms):
- [x] Implement bubble sort
- [x] Implement merge sort
- [ ] Implement insertion sort
- [ ] Implement bogo sort
### To do (Test script):
- [x] Implement bubble sort
- [x] Implement merge sort
- [ ] Implement insertion sort
- [ ] Implement bogo sort
